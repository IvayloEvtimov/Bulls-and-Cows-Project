  <description>In this game the computer randomly chooses a 4-digit number and the player has to guess what those 4 digits are.
During the course of the game the player will be notified if the guess was correct or how close he is to guessing the number.</description>
  <rules>The two ways of knowing how close the player is to guessing the number are:
Bull - the digit and the position are correct
Cow - the digit is correct but the position is not
If there are no Bulls and Cows then everything is wrong</rules>
